# Import necessary libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = {
    'Operating System': ['Windows', 'MacOS', 'Linux', 'Windows', 'MacOS', 'Linux', 'Windows', 'MacOS', 'Linux'],
    'Number of Apps': [100, 50, 75, 120, 60, 90, 110, 55, 85]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group by 'Operating System' and count the number of apps
grouped_df = df.groupby('Operating System')['Number of Apps'].sum().reset_index()

# Create a bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(grouped_df['Operating System'], grouped_df['Number of Apps'], color=['blue', 'green', 'red'])
plt.xlabel('Operating System')
plt.ylabel('Number of Apps')
plt.title('Number of Apps Installed by Operating System')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This code will create a bar plot with the operating system on the x-axis and the number of apps on the y-axis. The `groupby` function is used to group the data by operating system and count the number of apps for each group. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total number of apps for each group.

You can customize the plot as needed by changing the colors, labels, and title. You can also add more data to the plot by adding more rows to the `data` dictionary.

Note: This code assumes that you have the `matplotlib` and `pandas` libraries installed. If you don't have them installed, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas
plt.savefig('png_files/plot_0568e30a.png')
